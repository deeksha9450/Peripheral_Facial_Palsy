# Peripheral_Facial_Palsy
Peripheral Facial Palsy generally refers to weakness of the facial muscles, inability to move the muscles of the face. When the facial nerve is missing or not working properly, the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function properly.
When the facial nerve is missing or not working properly, the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function properly. This results in paralysis of the affected part of the face, which can affect the movement of the eye and/or the mouth, as well as other areas. 
It can be categorized into two types based on the location of the casual pathology:
Central facial palsy:  Due to damage above the facial nucleus 
Peripheral facial palsy:  Due to damage below the facial nucleus, there are differ 



***************************__Benefits of Early Detection__****************************** 

Facial Paralysis does not affect only movement of facial activities but also affects the mental health which includes Social Alienation, Depression, Emotional vulnerability due to loss of beauty. It’s very important to detect facial paralysis on its early stage so that it can be recovered before the fall of its physical as well as mental damage.  
1)Regular monitoring will help in early recovery
2)Tracking the recovery rate 
3)Tracking will help in creating a positive affirmation of recovery 
4)To save the patient from living a diminished quality of life

************************************__Risk factors__************************************* 
There are some factors that may increase your risk of developing Bell’s palsy. 
These include:
pregnancy
diabetes
hypertension (high blood pressure)
obesity
upper respiratory infection, as  common cold or the flu


************************************__Technology to be Used__*********************************
The face keypoint detection technology is used in this filter application .The marking of important areas of the face, such as the eyes, corners of the mouth, and nose, that are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, and pose recognition, using convolutional neural network and computer vision techniques to perform facial Keypoint detection.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has a deep structure that allows them to extract high-level information and provide better precision when identifying each important point. Convolutional networks are designed to anticipate all points at the same time.
